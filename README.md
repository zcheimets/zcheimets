## üöÄ Key Projects

### VataVerks
Develop and maintain C-based firmware using CMSIS and STM32 drivers for an internal-use board that automates programming and testing of water and gas measurement sensors.

### Bioastronautics and Life Support Systems
Parametric C# simulation for client ICON's Project Olympus, assessesing efficiency and risk of autonomous operations on a 3D printed lunar base
<!-- - **GitHub**: [View Project](https://github.com/Vets-Who-Code/VetsAI) -->

### NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory - Mars Sample Return Mission
Developed an embedded real-time communication protocol with RTOS using a heartbeat aliveness check via TCP/UDP network programming, enhancing asynchronous, multi-threaded task handling to boost system efficiency and reliability
<!-- TODO: add more projects and connect the repos to it-->

### VataVerks
Enhancing internal firmware to automate product programming, resulting in a 70% increase in efficiency.

## üéñÔ∏è Leadership & Community Impact
